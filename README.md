## Description

In this project, I utilized several advanced techniques for fine-tuning LLMs, including:
- **LoRA** and **QLoRA** for efficient fine-tuning
- **Llama**, **QLama**, **ORPO**, and **Unsloth** models for enhanced performance
- **Quantization Configuration** to make models lighter and faster in response
- **ORPO** for reinforcement learning in question-answering tasks
- **Unsloth** to speed up model learning
- **Vision Transformer** and **Big Vision** for fine-tuning on images
- **Multimodal LLM IDEFICS 9B** for Visual Question Answering
- **Auto Fine-Tuning** using **Llama Factory**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
